# Sharpness-Aware-Minimization
Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) was first introduced in the paper titled "Sharpness-Aware Minimization for Efficiently Improving Generalization" by Pierre Foret, Ariel Kleiner, Hossein Mobahi, and Behnam Neyshabur.
Based on the knowledge from that paper, we continue learning about variants of SAM that can be applied to solving optimization problems: SSAMF, SSAMD, FriendlySAM, IMBSAM. The source code is implemented in Python using the PyTorch framework.
